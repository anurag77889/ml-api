# If someone sends POST or PUT /health
# FastAPI wil return 405 method not allowed

# 400 -> Client sent wrong data
# 500 -> Server failed internally

# FastAPI converts your Python dictionary into JSON
# before sending it to Uvicorn

# FastAPI = framework logic + serialization
# Uvicorn = ASGI server (network layer)

# Uvicorn is an ASGI server which listens on a port 8000,
# accepts HTTP requests, forwards them to FastAPI, sends back
# FastAPI's response

# If data is invalid, then 422 - Unprocessable Entity

# Incoming request 
# FastAPI parses JSON 
# Pydantic validates schema
# If valid -> function runs and ML Inference
# If invalid -> function never runs 

# without PredictionInput there will be no type validation
# no required field enforcement, no automatic conversion,
# which leads to more bugs so USE IT 

# NEVER train model inside request

# App starts -> Load trained model into memory
# Request -> Use model for inference -> Respond

# we return [[]] because scikit-learn expects 
# (number_of_samples, number_of_features)
# [[age, salary]] # [] => no.of samples, 
#                 # age and salary => no.of features


# Exposing raw errors could lead to file paths, internal logic
# stack traces, db structure which attackers love so 
# trust is secondary, security is primary

# Validation error usually happens before business logic, 
# often from client side, schema mismatch, 422 or 400 code

# Inference error usually happens inside business logic,
# from server side, model or feature process fail, 500 code 

# Logs should go to log files, logging services like ELK
# or centralized log aggregators
